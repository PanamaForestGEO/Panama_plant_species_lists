Merging files for Panama woody plant species generally involves using the most up-to-date file in each of the following directories, which in turn means the most up-to-date version of the corresponding dataset. 

*Subdirectories*

**PanamaWoodySpLists** Contains files that are lists of all tree species or all woody plant species more generally in the country of Panama, often together with 6-letter codes assigned to these species by ForestGEO, and other info.  Includes only species with scientific names, no morphospecies.  

**Forestgeo** Contains files of tree species or woody plant species more generally that are present in ForestGEO plots or datasets in Panama, together with their 6-letter species codes and other info.  Includes recognized morphospecies and corresponding codes.
