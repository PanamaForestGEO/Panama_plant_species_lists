This directory contains species lists from Panamabiota.org.  At this time, these files focus on lists of plant species found on Barro Colorado Island, BCI.  

These files are downloaded from https://panamabiota.org/stri/checklists/checklist.php?clid=180&pid=20
The downloaded files are renamed to include the date on which they are downloaded.  

Here is information from Ed Gilbert about these lists.  This is from an email he sent (from egbot@asu.edu) to Helene Muller-Landau on 2026-01-14, in response to her query 


I’m looking for a good list of woody plant species of BCI that can be published as part of a PlantNet project – see email exchange below. The list I had put together previously simply amalgamated a few other lists of differing currency, possibly including (but I’m not sure at this time) something like the following that I pulled off of Panamabiota:  

https://panamabiota.org/stri/checklists/checklist.php?clid=178&pid=20 

So, my quick (I hope) questions are the following:
•	What is the basis for the Panamabiota plant species list for BCI? 
•	How good is this list?
•	How should that list be cited or credited if used elsewhere?

The BCI Plant list https://panamabiota.org/stri/checklists/checklist.php?clid=180&pid=20, which consists of 4 child checklists (including the “dicot” list you referenced), was originally created from an old list (https://panamabiota.org/stri/checklists/checklist.php?clid=64&pid=20), which cites a STRI list that no longer seems to be available (https://stri.si.edu/english/visit_us/barro_colorado/index.php). After building the child checklists, I appended the list with new taxa based on specimen vouchers collected on BCI, and removed taxa that lacked evidence of a specimen voucher. I’ve slowly been cleaning taxonomy and merging taxa that are list multiple times under different synonyms, but more cleaning is needed. Furthermore, the list likely contains taxa associated with misidentified specimen vouchers, which are challenging to resolve without viewing the specimens. I’m not truly sure of the overall quality of the list, but given that taxa are linked to physical specimen vouchers, it has potential to becoming an evidence-based checklist of quality with more work. I’m happy to continue working on this, but it would be better if it was led by someone in-country with more time to commit to it. 

Are you looking for a woody only list, of all taxa including monocots? If so, I could create one using these lists and taxonomic character information within the database. Or create a new list of BCI taxa that intersect with the lists below.
