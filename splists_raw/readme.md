Merging files for Panama woody plant species generally involves using the most up-to-date file in each of the following directories, which in turn means the most up-to-date version of the corresponding dataset. 

**Garwood_2009_Appendix1.csv** An electronic version of Appendix 1 of Garwood 2009.  This appendix is a list of all plant species known to be found on BCI, updating the list in Croat 1978.  (Full citations given at the end of this readme.)  

*Subdirectories*

**PanamaWoodySpLists** Contains files that are lists of all tree species or all woody plant species more generally in the country of Panama, often together with 6-letter codes assigned to these species by ForestGEO, and other info.  Includes only species with scientific names, no morphospecies.  

**Forestgeo** Contains files of tree species or woody plant species more generally that are present in ForestGEO plots or datasets in Panama, together with their 6-letter species codes and other info.  Includes recognized morphospecies and corresponding codes. 

**Wright** Contains files of plant species that appear in the seed, seedling, and other datasets collected in Panama under the supervision of S. Joseph Wright, together with the 4-letter species codes used in these studies and often corresponding 6-letter species codes.  Include some non-woody species and morphospecies.  

**Panamabiota** Contains files of plant species lists downloaded from panamabiota.org.  This includes both woody and non-woody species. The main aim at this time is to use this for BCI plant species lists (although that may change in the future). See Readme within that directory. 

**Plots** Contains files of the abundances of plant species in different plots in Panama.
