**FloraPanama_28Aug25_tnrsHM.xls** This is the *current best combined Panama woody plant species list* with documentation.
The first spreadsheet in this file, titled "data", is the same as
Perez-et-al_PanamaPlantSp_2025-03tnrsHM.xlsx (see below).  The other sheets provide a data dictionary, sources, and associated R code.  

**FloraPanama_28Aug25_tnrsHM.xls** The current best combined Panama woody plant species list with one row per species 
generated by the code "scripts/checkand mergesplists.r" based on processing 
the following files from the splists_raw directory:  
the current Forestgeo Panama plant species list from Rolando Perez ("Forestgeo/Perez-et-al_PanamaPlantSp_2025-03.xlsx"), 
reviewed against the prior Forestgeo tree species list from Suzanne Lao ("Forestgeo/ViewTaxonomy_2024-09-10HM.xlsx")
with sp4 codes added from a file from S. Joseph Wright ("Wright/nomenclature_R_20100224_Rready_fixed_tnrs.xlsx")
and names checked using the TNRS R package,
as well as numerous minor corrections documented in the code.  
This file includes morphospecies having ForestGEO codes.
