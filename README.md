# Panama_plant_species_lists

This github repository is intended to provide an up-to-date database of scientific names of plants (mostly woody plants) in Panama, 
together with their 6-letter and 4-letter codes (as used in Smithsonian research), and histories of changes in species names associated with these codes. 

# Contributors

Helene C. Muller-Landau created this github repository and wrote most of the code.  Antoine Caron-Guay added code for generating the Labelbox lists, which includes linking to gbif.  The readme for the splists_raw directory includes information on the authors of the raw/original species lists.  *Please make sure to appropriately credit the list authors.*
